# BlueSTSDKBinding
Objective-C binding project to enable using BlueSTSDK in C# projects.
Please look at ApiDefinition.cs for the API definitions in C# and refer to [BlueSTSDK_iOS GitHub project](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/BlueSTSDK_iOS) for the actual API defined in Obj-C and Swift.
The library (libBlueSTSDK_iOS.dll) generated by the binding project can be found in BlueSTSDKBinding/bin/debug folder. Alternately, one can use the binding project directly in a C# project according to [this article.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/ios/platform/binding-objective-c/walkthrough?tabs=macos#using-the-binding).
## Please Note:
- There is one change to the method signature in C# API: in the extension BlueSTSDKManager_BlueSTSDK_Swift_428, two methods share the same signature, but different argument labels. Since C# doesn't allow multiple functions with same signature, a new parameter (int x) was added to the didFailToConnect method .
- BlueSTSDKManager_BlueSTSDK_Swift_428 might need to implement ICBCentralManagerDelegate, but implementing that interface leads to a few errors, which are cyclical. The extension might need to implement this interface and the errors must be addressed somehow, but it hasn't been done yet.
